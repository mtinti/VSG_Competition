   ## *Project Description*
   
   We induced VSG gene recombination and switching in in vitro culture using CRISPR-Cas9 nuclease to target the active VSG
   We conclude that antigenic variants compete, and that the population of cells that activates minichromosome derived VSGs displays a competitive advantage. 
   Competition among variants impacts antigenic variation dynamics in African trypanosomes and likely prolongs immune evasion with a limited set of antigens.
